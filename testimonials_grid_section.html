                    I signed up for the free letro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best-and most grunting-time of my life. Since completing the course, I have successfully switched careers, working as a software engineer at a VB startup."

                <p class="dark-cream">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step.
                    I was encouraged to enrol by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the programs. The entire curriculum and staff did not dissappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project,in particular was outstanding.
                    It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. Infact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience.
                    It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! "
